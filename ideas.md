- single particle hamiltonian from energy spectrum
- superfluid stiffness/ rotation as an artificial gauge field
- binary search phase boundary
- what is a BEC? is U(1) SSB strictly necessary?
- DVR/gaussian quadrature (root finding via diagonalization.)
- finite state machines (enemy behaviour/MPO construction)
- Compute superfluid fraction for mean field BHM? use AD?
