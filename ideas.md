- single particle hamiltonian from energy spectrum
- what is a BEC? is U(1) SSB strictly necessary?
- DVR/gaussian quadrature (root finding via diagonalization.)
- finite state machines (enemy behaviour/MPO construction)
- Why does bogoliubov spectrum of quantum hamiltonian match exactly with linear excitations of the time dependant GPE which is entirely mean-field?
- imaginary time evolution as a gradient descent with a non trivial metric
