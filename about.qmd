Hi! I'm Akshay, a PhD student at [QuantumGroup@UGent](https://quantumghent.github.io/) with an interest in the exotic physics of Bose-Einstein condensates and programming. I am currently working on utilizing Tensor Network techniques to study BEC systems in the context of quantum simulation experiments. When I'm not performing research, I enjoy [making games](https://20akshay00.itch.io/) with the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/). You can find out more about the things I work on in my [main website](https://20akshay00.github.io).

Over the past year, I've found that my research seems to involve solving many tiny problems which have _some_ insight to offer but not enough to share in any usual platforms of scientific discourse. As an attempt to preserve these tidbits from fading into obscurity as I inevitably forget about them, I have begun documenting them here.
