[Superfluidity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z6UJbwxBZI) and [superconductivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GY4m022tgo) might be, in my opinion, one of the most intriguing phenomena that presents quantum behaviour at a macroscopic scale. They manifest in a variety of different manners depending on the geometry of the setup and other experimental conditions, However, it is widely accepted that fundamentally they are all caused due to the systems capacity to host hydrodynamic flow with zero viscosity/resistance. In this post, we will try to explore an interpretation that results in a microscopic description of superfluidity while making no references to viscosity or other dynamical responses.

# Characterizing superfluidity

When I think about superfluidity, few of the phenomena that immediately come to mind are supercreep and superleaks, where the fluid is able to seep through the pores of the container and climb out of the walls of the container respectively. While these are certainly the most eye-catching phenomena, they are not particularly nice to work with in a theoretical framework. Perhaps the most practically interesting manifestation of superfluidity is the persistence of metastable currents. Suppose we have a cylindrical bucket filled with a superfluid and it is rotated rapidly. If the rotation is now suddenly stopped, the fluid continues rotating for long time-scales without any dissipation! Such an effect is typically explained through the existence of quantized vortices in such superfluids (which arise due to the existence of a condensate, but we will come back to this). It is also fundamentally a dynamical/kinetic phenomena since it requires the existence of energy barriers that prevent decay to the true ground state of the system.

We instead consider another closely related effect, namely the Hess-Fairbank effect. Suppose the bucket is rotated at a very small angular velocity (upto some critical threshold that is determined by the geometry of the setup). Once the system has equilibriated, if we measure the moment of inertia of the system, it would be smaller than the expected value of a classical fluid! This lends itself to a phenomenological description of the system in terms of the well known two-fluid model, where the system behaves as a composite of a superfluid with density $\rho_s$ that carries no entropy or viscosity and the normal fluid with density $\rho_n$. Such a hydrodynamical treatment has had huge success, but in this post we will instead try to relate this superfluid fraction with microscopic features of the system.

# Arriving at a microscopic definition
Let us consider $N$ interacting bosons on a ring of radius $R$. In order to impart angular momentum to the system, we model the interaction between the bosons and the walls of the ring with a weak potential $\epsilon \cdot U(r - \Omega R t)$ that is rotating with an angular velocity $\Omega$ with a strength $\epsilon \ll 1$.

$$
H = \sum_i \left(-\frac{1}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r_i^2} + \epsilon \cdot U(r_i - \Omega R t)\right) + \sum_{i<j} V_{int}(|r_i - r_j|)
$$

In order to treat this system in a time-independent setting, we move over to the co-rotating frame of reference through a transformation $U(\Omega) = \exp(-i\Omega t \sum_i L_{z, i})$ where $L_{z, i}$ is the angular momentum operator of the $i^{th}$ boson.

\begin{align*}
H' &= UHU^{\dagger} + iU \frac{dU}{dt} U^{\dagger} \\
&= H - \sum_i \Omega L_{z, i} \\
&= \sum_i \left(-\frac{1}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r_i^2} + \epsilon \cdot U(r_i)\right) + \sum_{i<j} V_{int}(|r_i - r_j|) - \sum_i m\Omega r_i \frac{\partial}{\partial r_i} 
\end{align*}

Since the potential is very weak and only serves the purpose of imparting momentum such that the system may reach equilibrium, we can ignore it henceforth (one may imagine a process where the system is brought to equilibrium and then $\epsilon$ is turned off adiabatically). Now, suppose the angular velocity $\Omega \ll \Omega_c$ is small such that the superfluid fraction remains at rest in the lab frame. Then in the rotating frame, one would expect the mechanical angular momentum $\langle \mathcal{L}_z \rangle = \langle \sum_i m r_i \times v_i \rangle = -(\rho_s/\rho) I_{cl}$ where $I_{cl}=NmR^2$ is the classical moment of inertia. Note that $\mathcal{L_z} \neq L_z = \sum_i r_i \times p_i$ where $p_i$ is the canonical momentum, equivalent to the mechanical momentum as measured in the lab frame. 

To find the relation between these angular momenta, we notice that since the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame has changed, the commutation relation between the canonical linear momentum and the position operator has changed as well. Working in the Heisenberg picture, we have the velocity operator in the rotating frame, $v_i = dr/dt = [H', p] = p/m - \Omega r$ where we notice an extra centrifugal contribution as expected. This immediately gives us $\langle L_z \rangle = \langle \mathcal{L}_z\rangle + I_{cl} \cdot \Omega = -(\rho_s/\rho)\cdot I_{cl} \cdot\Omega + I_{cl} \cdot \Omega = (\rho_n/\rho) \cdot I_{cl} \cdot \Omega$, which is exactly what we would expect since the angular momentum as measured from the lab frame would only have contributions from the normal fraction. Now, to relate this with a measurable property of the system, we use the Hellman-Feynman theorem:

$$
\frac{dE}{d\Omega} = \left \langle \frac{d H}{d \Omega} \right \rangle = \langle L_z \rangle = -(\rho_s/\rho)\cdot I_{cl} \cdot\Omega + I_{cl} \cdot \Omega
$$

We thus notice that the second derivative of the energy with respect to the angular momentum gives us the normal fraction of the system. However, at this point we must realize that the fact that this relation arose specifically from a rotating setup is simply obfuscating a more general property of the ground state of the system. We can see this more clearly if we rewrite the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame in a slightly different manner;

$$
H' = \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2m} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial r_i} - m \Omega r_i\right)^2 + \sum_{i<j} V_{int}(|r_i - r_j|) + \sum_i \frac{1}{2}m \Omega^2 r_i^2
$$

We see that in this form, the rotation simply acts as an artifical gauge field $A_i = m\Omega r_i$. It is an artificial one since it additionally alters the Hamiltonian by adding a centrifugal term (which is exactly what gives rise to the $I_{cl} \cdot \Omega$ term in our expression for $dE/d\Omega = \langle L_z \rangle$). This is also where we may draw a parallel with superconductivity where the role of the gauge field is played by the magnetic vector potential instead.

At this point, we can recover the original Hamiltonian (upto the centrifugal term) by simply performing the following transformation $\psi(r_1, \dots, r_N) \to \exp(i \cdot m\Omega R\sum_i r_i) \cdot \psi(r_1, \dots, r_N)$. This gets rid of the gauge potential term, and transfers the burden onto the boundary conditions instead. While the system original obeyed periodic boundary conditions where $\psi(r_1 + 2\pi R, \dots, r_N) = \psi(r_1, \dots, r_N)$, we now have twisted boundary conditions where $\psi(r_1 + 2\pi R, \dots, r_N) = \exp(2\pi i \cdot m\Omega R^2 \Omega) \cdot \psi(r_1, \dots, r_N)$. Now we can forget that we arrived here from the context of a rotating system (and along with it, throw away the annoying centrifugal term that has been tagging along) and cast this result in a completely abstract manner.

The superfluid fraction is then defined like so (there are proportionality factors depending on the system size, etc, that I have not explicitly written): 
$$
    \frac{d^2 E}{d\theta^2} \sim \frac{\rho_s}{\rho}
$$

Where $E$ is the ground state energy of the original Hamiltonian under twisted boundary conditions $\psi(r_1 + 2\pi R, \dots, r_N) = \exp(i \theta) \cdot \psi(r_1, \dots, r_N)$. We thus see that the superfluid response of a system is not really tied to rotation specifically, but rather to the resistance of the system to phase twists. If the energy remains the same under a twist, the system does not exhibit superfluidity. This notion somehow ties in nicely with our intuitive understanding that superfluidity is intimately related to the phase of the system (generally the superfluid velocity can be written as the gradient of the phase of a condensate wave-function).

Now that we have a concrete measure of an aspect of superfluidity, a very interesting question arises. When exactly does a many-body system exhibit this property? We know that a dilute Bose gas exhibits superfluidity and also forms a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Similarly, we have Cooper pairs of electrons in a metal that condense in similar manner to a BEC and exhibits superconductivity. It clearly seems that superfluidity is closely related to the idea of condensation and $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. One may even be enticed to make the equivalence of the condensate fraction with the superfluid fraction of the system. However, we know for a fact that at $T=0$, He$^4$ (the first superfluid we discovered) has a superfluid fraction of $1$, but only a condensate fraction of $\sim 0.1$. We are thus forced to accept that the relation between superfluidity and condensation is much more nuanced than that. Perhaps we will revisit this idea in more depth sometime.
